Demo - Yahoo Weather using Futures
============================
A demo app created for my workshop at Cloud Weekend Event.  
The slides are available here https://www.slideshare.net/tamer_radi/playing-with-scala

Getting Started
===========
First of all, make sure that you have a [working Play installation](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Installing),  
Second, Clone the repo
Finally, in you console, `cd` to the code directory, and type `play run`

About the Code
============
The interesting code (related to Futures), lives in the controller, Check [Application.scala](weather/app/controllers/Application.scala).  

Feel free to do whatever you want with code, you can even ask me.
